# homework2-CSS-Bootsrap

## Descripton:

# I create this website using collapsible Bootsrap properties. This website consists of an index.html name as "About me", a Portfolio page and an About me page. All pages were has responsive to any large, medium and small size device screens. I used container and content are and Bootstrap Grid system to design my pages. My portfolio is about my education and work experiences. I used my university and work places pictures to create this portfolio page. "Contact me" page includes name, e-mail and message input areas that work properly.
